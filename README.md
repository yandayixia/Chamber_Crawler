#Chamber_Crawler
A dungeon crawler our group created as the final project for CS246, the object oriented programming course at the University of Waterloo. The entire project is completely implemented using c++. 

The final draft of our UML diagram is also included to help other fellowprogrammer better understanding the structure of our classes. Many design patterns are exploited in this project, namingly the visitor pattern and the observer pattern. A makefile script was also included to simplify the developement.

The entire project took 2 weeks to finish with a group of me and my partner, Linna Zheng. This project would have not been possible without her help on my own.

To compile the game, clone the repository and evoke makefile. The executeable file is called cc3k, and to play the game, call:
=>$ ./cc3k map.txt
